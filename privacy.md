# Privacy Policy for Proxycheck Extension

## Introduction

The Proxycheck extension ("the Extension") is designed to provide users with functionality to check IP and email addresses using the Proxycheck.io API and to block Autonomous System Numbers (ASN) in Cloudflare. This document outlines the privacy practices of the Extension and provides transparency on how your information is handled.

## Information Collection

The Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data from users to the developer. Any data input into the Extension, such as API keys, Account ID, login details, IP addresses, or email addresses, is processed locally in the browser and is not transmitted to the developer but will be sent to the respective third party with the user's explicit interaction.

## Use of Third-Party Services

The Extension interacts with the following third-party services for its core functionality:

- **Proxycheck.io**: Used to check the status of IP addresses. The Extension sends the IP address to Proxycheck.io to perform these checks.
- **Cloudflare**: Used to block certain ASNs or IP addresses. The Extension uses Cloudflare's API to apply blocking rules as specified by the user.

These third-party services may collect information in accordance with their respective privacy policies. Users are encouraged to review the privacy policies of these services:

- [Proxycheck.io Privacy Policy](https://proxycheck.io/privacy)
- [Cloudflare Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/)

The developer of this Extension is not responsible for data collection or processing performed by these third-party services.

## Data Security

The Extension processes all user-provided data locally within the user's browser. No information is sent to the developer, and no data is stored or logged by the Extension itself. However, data shared with third-party services, as described above, is subject to the security practices of those services.

## User Consent

By using the Extension, users consent to the processing of IP addresses and other related information as needed to fulfill the core functionality provided by Proxycheck.io and Cloudflare. The developer does not have access to, nor does it receive, any user data.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect any changes in functionality or practices. Users are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.

## Contact Information

If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, you can contact the developer at [proxycheck@example.com].
