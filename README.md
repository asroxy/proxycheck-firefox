#### Description
This extension fetches information for a given IP address or email address using the proxycheck.io service. It also optionally allows the user to block the IP or ASN associated with the IP in Cloudflare. If you need more information on the IP or ASN, you can click on the ANS number in the modal popover and it will load the ASN details page provided by IPInfo.io. 

#### Requirements
This plugin requires the user to have a Proxycheck API key to perform checks. It also requires a Cloudflare Global API key, the account email address and account ID. This plugin adds the blocks to the account, not an individual domain (zone ID).
